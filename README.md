# Detroubulator

This repository contains the version 1.1.0 source code of Detroubulator, an open source unit test tool for SAP XI/PI mapping programs.

The project is no longer being maintained, and the repository is therefore archived.

For a look back at the project, and some thoughts on the code a number of years later, please see [this SAP Community blog post]( https://blogs.sap.com/2019/06/30/code-archaeology-a-detroubulator-retrospective).
